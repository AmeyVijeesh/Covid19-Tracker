# Another covid 19 tracker....

This is the second covid 19 tracker made by me. By, there is a huge change this time. It is made of **Tkinter**. In case you wnat to have **PyQt5**
as the GUI, click here: *https://github.com/AmeyVijeesh/Covid-19-tracker*.

As you already know, the CoronaVirus is a pandemic that has suspended us from our daily activities. If you want a **Covid 19 Tracker**, you have come to 
the correct place. You can track the covid 19 cases of all the countries in the world with this app. Made using Tkinter, it is an easy to use app 
with a good GUI.

# Program

The app needs only two modules, that is the Tkinter, which comes build-in with python. You will also need the **Covid Module**.

To install the covid module, type:

```
pip install covid

```

Hope you enjoy the program,
Thank you!
